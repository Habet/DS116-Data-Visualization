# DS116-Data-Visualization

These are lecture notes, slides, and R Markdown files for the DS116 Data Visualization course, developed and prepared by Dr. Habet Madoyan at the American University of Armenia.

These lecture notes would not be what they are without the invaluable help and constructive feedback from those who worked with me as teaching assistants/associates. Their support has been instrumental in refining and developing these materials.
